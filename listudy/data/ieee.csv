Traffic flow prediction is the key input of active traffic control systems. Accurately predicting road traffic flow is the basic guarantee for the realization of intelligent transportation. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of road traffic flow, this paper proposes a short-term traffic flow prediction method based on the space-time fusion framework. This method uses traffic flow rate, occupancy rate and weather factors to make short-term predictions of traffic flow. Under the framework of space-time fusion, four traffic flow prediction methods are studied: deep neural networks, distributed random forests, gradient propulsion machines and the related performance of generalized linear models. The experiment uses traffic data from Shangtang Elevated Road in Hangzhou City for calibration and evaluation. The results show that under the framework of space-time fusion, the results obtained by the above four prediction models are very similar and can accurately predict road traffic flow. Among them, the accuracy of the distributed random forest model is better than the other three methods.","","978-1-6654-5521-3","10.1109/ISoIRS57349.2022.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10196698","Traffic perception data;Short term traffic flow prediction;Intelligent transportation system;Deep learning;Spatiotemporal fusion model","Measurement;Roads;Transportation;Predictive models;Traffic control;Data models;Road traffic","backpropagation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);intelligent transportation systems;random forests;recurrent neural nets;road traffic;traffic control;traffic engineering computing","active accident management system;active shift limit;active traffic control systems;intelligent transportation system;prediction accuracy;prediction models;road traffic flow;short-term predictions;short-term traffic flow prediction method;space-time fusion framework;spatial short-term traffic flow forecasting model;traffic data;traffic flow prediction methods;traffic flow rate","","","","13","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An essential component of such models is the origin-destination matrix, which is traditionally generated using roadside and/or household surveys. These surveys are expensive, time consuming and do not capture temporal variation in travel demand. Anonymised location data from cell phones present an alternative source of mobility information which is passively collected, widely available and naturally captures temporal trends. However, these data contain other biases which must be corrected for using more reliable data. In this study, data from the Radio Network Controller of the Andorran telecom company is combined with limited traffic count data in order to develop a calibrated urban transportation model. An initial trip matrix is generated from the telecom data and a parameterized correction model is used to modify the trip matrix before predicting traffic. The parameters of the correction model are optimized by solving a Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints. Outof-sample predictions from the calibrated model are shown to agree well with actual traffic volumes. This approach can reduce or eliminate the need for travel surveys while improving understanding of travel demands and traffic.","","978-1-7281-4149-7","10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9294614","","Roads;Data models;Telecommunications;Calibration;Biological system modeling;Urban areas;Transportation","calibration;mathematical programming;matrix algebra;mobile computing;optimisation;road traffic;telecommunication traffic;traffic engineering computing;transportation","travel demand;traffic prediction;cell phone data;mathematical program;equilibrium constraints;transportation models;network performance;origin-destination matrix;roadside;anonymised location data;cell phones;captures temporal trends;Radio Network Controller;traffic count data;calibrated urban transportation model;initial trip matrix;telecom data;parameterized correction model;outof-sample predictions;calibrated model;travel surveys","","3","","42","IEEE","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the current traffic prediction methods based on deep learning show better performance than traditional prediction methods, they still have the following problems: (1) In spatial domain, the correlations between cellular traffic features cannot be captured accurately in non-local (including “geographic adjacency” and long-distance) spatial areas. (2) In temporal domain, the correlation of different time-grained features is failed to consider. To address these problems, a deep learning method considering dynamic non-local spatial correlation, self-attention, and correlation of spatio-temporal feature fusion is proposed. In spatial domain, our method can accurately capture the spatial correlation and highlight the contribution of more relevant traffic in the non-local area by designing a NLG-NLAM model. In temporal domain, the correlations of time-periodic features with different granularities are considered to clarify the key roles of different periodic features and eliminate the influence of irrelevant cellular traffic features on the prediction by designing a calibration layer.

Most studies acquire pre-collision traffic conditions by matching the collision time in the national crash database with the time in the traffic database. Since the reported collision time sometimes differs from the actual time, the matching method may result in traffic conditions not representative of pre-collision traffic dynamics. In this paper, this is overcome through the use of highly disaggregated vehicle-based traffic data from a traffic micro-simulation (i.e., VISSIM) and the corresponding traffic conflicts data generated by the surrogate safety assessment model (SSAM). In particular, the idea is to use traffic conflicts as surrogate measures of traffic safety so that traffic collisions data are not needed. Three classifiers (i.e., support vector machines, k-nearest neighbours, and random forests) are then employed to examine the proposed idea. Substantial efforts are devoted to making the traffic simulation as representative of the real-world as possible by employing data from a motorway section in England. Four temporally aggregated traffic datasets (i.e., 30 s, 1 min, 3 min, and 5 min) are examined. The main results demonstrate the viability of using traffic micro-simulation along with the SSAM for real-time conflicts prediction and the superiority of random forests with 5-min temporal aggregation in the classification results. However, attention should be given to the calibration and validation of the simulation software so as to acquire more realistic traffic data, resulting in more effective prediction of conflicts.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2017.2769158","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/J011525/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8171202","Traffic safety;traffic conflicts;traffic micro-simulation;support vector machines (SVMs);k-nearest neighbours (k-NN);random forests (RFs)","Real-time systems;Safety;Data models;Software;Support vector machines;Predictive models;Vehicle dynamics","nearest neighbour methods;pattern classification;random processes;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing","normal traffic conditions;pre-collision traffic conditions;national crash database;traffic database;pre-collision traffic dynamics;traffic microsimulation;surrogate safety assessment model;traffic safety;traffic collisions data;traffic simulation;real-time conflicts prediction;realistic traffic data;collision time;real-time conflict-prone traffic conditions prediction;traffic collision probability;matching method;vehicle-based traffic data;random forests;support vector machines;k-nearest neighbours;traffic conflicts data","","26","","64","CCBY","8 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The availability of vehicle trajectories has provided a promising data source for traffic estimation, as it shed light on traffic status and characterizes human transition activates that are otherwise extremely hard to track. However, there are major challenges in incorporating trajectories in traffic estimation largely because of its inherent uncertainty from data sparsity and semantic ambiguity. Entangled in complicated road topology and spatiotemporal traffic dynamics, properly embedding trajectories in modeling is especially difficult. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we propose a Boosted Trajectory Calibration (BTRAC) framework to model traffic states of complex road networks that effectively integrates trajectory information. In the framework, we first use a deep neural network to predict the traffic states of each road individually from historical traffic information, along with the prediction uncertainty. Then we refine the predictions by an iterative boosting calibration procedure with embedded trajectories. We conduct extensive large-scale empirical studies on two cities and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","2374-8486","978-1-7281-4604-1","10.1109/ICDM.2019.00097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970880","urban traffic state estimation, trajectories em bedding, spatiotemporal calibration","","intelligent transportation systems;neural nets;road traffic;state estimation;traffic information systems","historical traffic information;traffic state estimation;intelligent transport systems;vehicle dispatch;vehicle trajectories;data source;spatiotemporal traffic dynamics;trajectory information;boosted trajectory calibration framework","","7","","40","IEEE","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is unclear whether the single-image calibration will be successful in practice, particularly when the number of 2D-3D correspondences is small, even if we could assign accurate correspondences by manual labor. To this end, we perform a systematic evaluation of the camera parameter accuracy using synthetic environments. Based on the statistics observed during the experiments, our application predicts the calibration accuracy from simple variables (e.g., the area that correspondences could be given).

DynasTIM has been developed by the author for around 15 years. It was originally designed as a simulation based dynamic traffic assignment system. What follows is the addition of some new features, including the application and functional architectures of the system, dynamic OD(Origin-Destination) flows estimation based on analytical assignment matrices, mesoscopic traffic model with variable-length speed influence region and online speed calibration capability based on probe vehicles and connected vehicles data, and urban area signal optimization with parallel SPSA algorithm. DynasTIM achieves the functionality through three modules: state estimation (ES), state prediction and control strategy optimization (PS&CSO), and guidance strategy optimization (GSO). The case study is based on a populated network from the Futian Central Business District (CBD) in Shenzhen, China, with the area of around 7 square kilometers.

Results indicate that it is capable of reproducing the actual traffic counts fairly well. We also evaluated the signal optimization method for the network with 38 signal control intersections, which led to better-performing signal plans and around 13% reduction in the average travel delay, in comparison with the plans currently implemented in the field.","2688-0938","978-1-7281-4094-0","10.1109/CAC48633.2019.8996759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8996759","Dynamic traffic assignment;Traffic simulation;Mesoscopic traffic model;Traffic control;Simulation based optimization","Optimization;Real-time systems;Vehicle dynamics;Traffic control;Data models;Predictive models;State estimation","matrix algebra;optimisation;road traffic control;road vehicles;stochastic processes","state prediction;urban area signal optimization;connected vehicle data;online speed calibration capability;variable-length speed influence region;mesoscopic traffic model;analytical assignment matrices;origin-destination;dynamic OD;functional architectures;dynamic traffic assignment system;intelligent transportation systems;urban intercity networks;real-time software system;optimization system;real-time online traffic simulation;signal optimization method;real-world traffic conditions;DynasTIM;guidance strategy optimization;control strategy optimization","","2","","22","IEEE","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A model-based controller consists of two components: a plant model that represents reality; and a prediction model used to determine optimal control actions. In most studies, the authors assume a constant average trip length for all drivers traveling within the same region, for the prediction model. In these studies about perimeter control and MFD traffic models, the controllers show a good performance because accumulations, i.e. traffic states, from the plant are used to reflect the initial state of the prediction model with a high frequency (about a few seconds). However, this average trip length changes over time as it depends on the Origin-Destination flow decomposition, playing an important role in real applications. The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we show that the assumption about constant trip lengths used in the prediction model deteriorates the controller’s performance for low frequency updates of the optimal control actions. Second, we propose a methodological framework based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for dynamically adjusting the average trip lengths and accumulations. Our test results on a real city network show that applying this methodological framework significantly improves the controller’s performance.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3049679","NYUAD Center for Interacting Urban Network (CITIES); Tamkeen under the NYUAD Research Institute(grant numbers:CG001); Swiss Re Institute under the Quantum CitiesTM initiative; European Research Council (ERC) through the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:646592-MAGnUM Project); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9349157","Dynamic trip lengths;macroscopic fundamental diagram traffic models;nonlinear model predictive control;unsented Kalman filter;multi-regional networks","Urban areas;Predictive models;Vehicles;Optimal control;Calibration;Uncertainty;Vehicle dynamics","calibration;Kalman filters;optimal control;road traffic;road traffic control;traffic control","MFD-based perimeter control;specific urban region;model-based controller;plant model;prediction model;optimal control actions;constant average trip length;MFD traffic models;traffic states;constant trip lengths;trip lengths calibration;model-based perimeter control strategies;traffic control strategies","","4","","51","IEEE","5 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, whether the simulated traffic conflicts can predict crashes reliably is still an open question. This study aims at investigating the prediction validity of simulated traffic conflicts using the extreme value approach. The traffic simulation models were developed based on real-world data from four approaches of a signalized intersection and calibrated using a two-step calibration procedure that aimed at enhancing the correlation between simulated conflicts and actual field-measured conflicts. Extreme value models were developed for field conflicts and simulated conflicts of three scenarios (i.e., default, first-step calibration and second-step calibration) separately, and then the model estimated crashes were compared to observed crashes for the purpose of performance evaluation. The results show that after the second-step calibration, a high correlation between simulated conflicts and field conflicts is achieved, but the estimated crashes from these simulated conflicts are not as good as field conflicts and are with systematic underestimation. Nevertheless, each effort of simulation model calibration has shown progressive improvement in terms of crash estimation accuracy and similarity of extreme value distributions between simulated conflicts and field conflicts. This finding implies the possibility of predicting crashes reliably from simulated conflicts with proper calibration.","","978-1-5386-7024-8","10.1109/ITSC.2019.8916905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8916905","","Computer crashes;Vehicle crash testing;Calibration;Correlation;Analytical models;Videos;Data models","calibration;road safety;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","microscopic traffic simulation;extreme value approach;traffic simulation models;field-measured conflicts;field conflicts;calibration;simulation model calibration;simulated traffic conflicts","","5","","40","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The spatial detector is used to prune the output of the temporal detector, identifying those anomalies which are not consistent with measurements from neighboring sensors. Both temporal and spatial prediction use the widely adopted ARIMA model.

Parking management departments around the world focus on intelligent parking system in order to solve parking problems, but most of them are limited to upgrading the parking infrastructure. There is no effective solution from a perspective of the fundamental cause to solve the parking problem. At present, it is generally believed that parking guidance systems can effectively alleviate parking problems and provide drivers and traffic managers with real-time and accurate parking information. As one of the prerequisites of the parking guidance system, the accuracy of the short-term parking demand prediction method determines whether the implementation of the parking guidance scheme can effectively solve the parking problem in a certain area. Based on this, we have studied a short-term parking demand prediction in this paper. First, focusing on the distribution of typical parking arrivals and departures regular pattern, a parking demand prediction model was constructed utilizing the Markov birth and death process, and model parameters were calibrated utilizing curve fitting method and undetermined coefficients method. The simulation environment was set up utilizing the Markov process to verify the accuracy of the availability of parameter estimation method. Secondly, a method for determining the prediction interval based on the parking trend was given for different situations with the parking rush hours and ordinary hours which parking arrival and departure parameters were different. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model in practical applications, parking arrival and departure data from June 17 to June 23, 2019 in Jilin University of Nanling Campus was used to verify the short-term parking demand prediction method proposed in this paper. The results show that the parking demand prediction model proposed in this paper can accurately calibrate model parameters, predict parking demand quickly and effectively and provide theoretical reference and technical support for parking planning and management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2976433","Basic Scientific Research Project of Liaoning Education Department(grant numbers:LQ2017002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016013","Short-term parking demand prediction;parking arrival patterns;parking departure patterns;queuing model","Predictive models;Neural networks;Market research;Markov processes;Time series analysis;Mathematical model","automobiles;calibration;curve fitting;driver information systems;Markov processes;parameter estimation;road safety;road traffic;road traffic control;traffic control;traffic engineering computing","accurate parking information;parking infrastructure;intelligent parking system;parking management departments;parking planning;parking arrival;parking rush hours;parking trend;parking demand prediction model;parking problem;parking guidance scheme;short-term parking demand prediction method;parking guidance system","","12","","32","CCBY","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The accuracy and reliability of these applications are greatly dependent on the appropriate calibration of car-following models. In this paper, the authors developed a process to apply a stochastic calibration method with appropriate regularization to estimate the distribution of parameters for car-following models. The calibration method is based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation that uses the Bayesian estimation theory. An intelligent driver model and Helly's car-following model were utilized to evaluate this method. The Bayesian approach provided better results in terms of the cost function than the deterministic optimization algorithm. With the Bayesian approach, the mean square error per vehicle is decreased with the increased number of vehicles. Analysis also revealed that the Bayesian approach predicted drivers' speed and acceleration/deceleration profiles more closely to the real-world data compared with the deterministic approach evaluated in this paper.

Although it has been discussed in the calibration literature, the usage and applicability were not fully investigated. The state augmentation technique is particularly useful for delayed systems, for example in large networks with high travel times. In this paper, we discuss state augmentation for Kalman filtering and illustrate its modeling advantages via a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) representation.

The heterogeneous car-following (CF) behavior of HDVs can degrade the control performance of CAVs and introduce inefficiencies in CAV operations. To address these challenges, it is necessary to comprehend HDV CF behavior in mixed-flow traffic. This driving simulator-based study investigates HDV CF behavior in mixed-flow traffic under three different CAV control settings (string-stable, string-unstable, and HDV-like). The effects of traffic congestion level and demographic characteristics on CF behavior are also considered. Statistical analysis and CF model calibration, based on trajectory data collected from 72 participants in driving simulator experiments, are performed to examine the impacts of these factors on string stability, traffic efficiency, and safety. Then, online parameter estimation is conducted to illustrate the time-varying desired time headway, and sensitivity to spacing and speed variations (i.e., CF behavior evolution). Additionally, analysis of post-experiment interview results and eye-tracking data show that the string-stable CAV control setting is preferred by most HDV drivers, but can trigger driver distraction. The results also provide insights for CF behavior prediction and the optimal mixed platoon formation to enhance CAV benefits for traffic flow.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2023.3257962","Georgia Institute of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10073653","Mixed-flow traffic;car-following behavior;driving simulator;string stability;parameter estimation","Behavioral sciences;Trajectory;Safety;Lead;Fluctuations;Autonomous vehicles;Stability criteria","automobiles;driver information systems;intelligent transportation systems;mobile robots;parameter estimation;road safety;road traffic;road traffic control;road vehicles;statistical analysis;traffic engineering computing","autonomous vehicles;CF behavior evolution;CF behavior prediction;CF model calibration;different CAV control settings;driving simulator study;driving simulator-based study;HDV CF behavior;heterogeneous car-following behavior;human-driven vehicles;mixed-flow traffic;string-stable CAV control setting;traffic congestion level;traffic efficiency;traffic flow","","1","","40","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this problem, we propose a novel Data Uncertainty-Driven Loss (DUD Loss), which could derive the uncertainty from the input image, during the camera calibration process. Instead of estimating the camera extrinsic parameter as scalars, the proposed method models it as a Gaussian distribution with its variance represents the uncertainty of the input image. Hence, each camera parameter is no longer a deterministic scalar, but a probabilistic value with diverse distribution possibilities. With the help of DUD loss, the network can be trained to alleviate the perturbations caused by noisy input images. Furthermore, in the real-world single image camera calibration scenario, noisy input images, which yield larger variance/uncertainty could be effectively omitted without increasing the computation cost. To evaluate our method, we propose a large-scale Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaborative Autonomous Driving dataset, which contains millions of objects (e.g., cars, trucks, pedestrians) along with the camera calibration parameters (i.e., roll, pitch, yaw angles, and height of the camera setting position), dubbed as VICAD. Extensive experiments conducted on the proposed database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

For example, ITS and the Internet of Things (IoT) have facilitated the collection of transportation data. This sets off a chain reaction of data-driven investigations into transportation anomalies.Deep learning theory is a potential technique for dealing with big, multidimensional datasets. For this research, deep learning theory will be used to analyze large-scale transportation networks.

Subsequently, two independent sub-neural networks maximizing the heterogeneous log-likelihood are developed to estimate aleatoric uncertainty. For estimating epistemic uncertainty, we combine the merits of variational inference and deep ensembling by integrating the Monte Carlo dropout and the Adaptive Weight Averaging re-training methods, respectively. Finally, we propose a post-processing calibration approach based on Temperature Scaling, which improves the model’s generalization ability to estimate uncertainty.

They have been applied on a broad range of mobility-related tasks like the analysis of traffic phenomena, microscopic traffic simulations or single vehicle behavior prediction. Although car-following models can be formulated with explicit delays, the IDM is generally used in form of a time-continuous differential equation without delays. One reason is that in early IDM parameter calibration work it was found that the effect of the explicit delay is negligible. In this paper, we reopen the question of the importance of delays for accurate trajectory modeling, based on an analysis with real trajectories. We show that indeed both trajectory matching and prediction errors are strongly reduced when considering delays, enabling and improving their usage for safety-relevant scenarios like required for behavior prediction in intelligent Adaptive Driving Assistant Systems (ADAS). In addition, from optimizing the match of the model with real trajectories we gain a delay distribution that resembles the distribution of human driver reaction times.","","978-1-6654-6880-0","10.1109/ITSC55140.2022.9922289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9922289","","Adaptation models;Microscopy;Traffic control;Mathematical models;Delays;Trajectory;Behavioral sciences","automobiles;differential equations;driver information systems;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","time-continuous differential equation;early IDM parameter calibration work;explicit delay;accurate trajectory modeling;trajectory matching;prediction errors;considering delays;intelligent Adaptive Driving Assistant Systems;delay distribution;human driver reaction times;robustifying car-following models;explicit reaction times;Intelligent Driver Model;longitudinal behavior;ego-car;leading vehicle;mobility-related tasks;traffic phenomena;microscopic traffic simulations;single vehicle behavior prediction","","","","21","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The visualization of driving behavior on time series data samples could give an understanding and review of the driver's continuous actions. However, there has been little progress in combining the multi-modal vehicle and driver information on driving behavior learning and visualization. A multi-information driving behavior learning and visualization method with natural gaze prediction is proposed in this paper, which automatically integrates driver's gaze direction estimated from face camera, and various vehicle sensor data collected from on-board diagnostics (OBD) system. To accurately estimate the eye gaze under large head movement, a novel head pose-free eye gaze prediction method without calibration is proposed based on global and local scale sparse encoding, which treats the direction mapping as small gaze region classification. To understand driving behavior more intuitively, the latent features that represent different driving behaviors are extracted by FastICA from the fused time series data, and mapped into RGB color space for distinguished visualization.

In this paper, pedestrian path prediction at a time horizon of 2s for autonomous driving is systematically investigated using waiting/crossing decision model (W/CDM) and modified social force model (MSFM), and the possible conflict between pedestrians and straight-going vehicles at an un-signalized crosswalk is focused on. First of all, a W/CDM is efficiently developed to judge pedestrians' waiting/crossing intentions when a straight-going vehicle is approaching. Then the humanoid micro-dynamic MSFM of pedestrians who have been judged to cross is characterized by taking into account the evasion with conflicting pedestrians, the collision avoidance with straight-going vehicles, and the reaction to crosswalk boundary. The influence of pedestrian heterogeneous characteristics is considered for the first time. Moreover, aerial video data of pedestrians and vehicles at an un-signalized crosswalk is collected and analyzed for model calibration. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is proposed to calibrate the non-measurable parameters of the proposed models. Finally, the model validation is conducted with two cases by comparing with the existing methods. The result reveals that the integrated method (W/CDM-MSFM) outperforms the existing methods and accurately predicts the path of pedestrians, which can give us great confidence to use the current method to predict the path of pedestrian for autonomous driving with significant accuracy and highly improve pedestrian safety.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.2979231","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51677118); National Key Research and Development Plan Key Special Project(grant numbers:2017YFE0102000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9036079","Pedestrian path prediction;autonomous driving;waiting/crossing decision model (W/CDM);modified social force model (MSFM);maximum likelihood estimation (MLE);un-signalized crosswalk","Autonomous vehicles;Predictive models;Maximum likelihood estimation;Safety;Collision avoidance;Force;Accidents","calibration;collision avoidance;maximum likelihood estimation;mobile robots;pedestrians;road safety;road vehicles","pedestrian path prediction;autonomous driving;pedestrian trajectory prediction;collision avoidance;autonomous vehicles;modified social force model;microdynamic MSFM;crosswalk boundary;pedestrian heterogeneous characteristics;model calibration;pedestrian safety;un-signalized crosswalk;W-CDM;waiting-crossingdecision model;straight-going vehicles;aerial video data;maximum likelihood estimation","","14","","35","IEEE","13 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we first leverage a spatio-temporal model to model the complex spatio-temporal correlations of traffic data. Subsequently, two independent sub-neural networks maximizing the heterogeneous log-likelihood are developed to estimate aleatoric uncertainty. To estimate epistemic uncertainty, we combine the merits of variational inference and deep ensembling by integrating the Monte Carlo dropout and the Adaptive Weight Averaging re-training methods, respectively. Furthermore, to relax the Gaussianity assumption, mitigate overfitting, and improve horizon-wise uncertainty quantification performance, we define a new calibration method called Multi-horizon Conformal Calibration (MHCC).

In order to realize this vision, a seamless low-latency and ultrareliable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication network is required. Thus, it is of importance to characterize the V2V channels in various realistic environments, especially when the line-of-sight between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) is obstructed. In this paper, we characterize obstructed V2V channels in the 5-GHz band through measurement-calibrated ray-tracing (RT) simulations. To begin, the main objects in the real world are divided into two groups: 1) the small-scale structures (e.g., lampposts, traffic signs, etc.) and 2) the large-scale structures (such as buildings and ground). Then, we integrate the radar cross sections of the small-scale structures into our RT simulator through a framework based on high frequency prediction techniques. For the large-scale structures, we calibrate the electromagnetic and scattering parameters of the large-scale structures through V2V channel measurements. After such integration and calibration, extensive RT simulations for V2V channels with Tx and Rx located on vehicles traveling in the opposite or same direction are realized with various antenna deployments in urban and open space environments, with and without sloped terrain. Based on the RT results, we characterize the path loss, shadow fading, and delay spread of the channel for each case, and show agreement with measured results in the literature for all these channel characteristics.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2872437","Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:L161009); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(grant numbers:2018ZX03001031); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771036,61501021,61725101); State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety(grant numbers:RCS2018ZZ006,RCS2017ZT008); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2017JBM077,2017JBM010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8473696","Internet of Intelligent Vehicles (IoIV);ray-tracing (RT);shadowing;vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channels","Scattering;Shadow mapping;Internet of Things;Antenna measurements;Buildings;Intelligent vehicles","electromagnetic wave scattering;radar cross-sections;radar transmitters;radio receivers;radio transmitters;radiowave propagation;ray tracing;telecommunication network reliability;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless channels","vehicular transportation applications;measurement-calibrated ray-tracing simulations;small-scale structures;large-scale structures;channel characteristics;Internet of Intelligent Vehicles;vehicular ad-hoc networks;V2V channels;low-latency vehicle-to-vehicle communication network;ultrareliable vehicle-to-vehicle communication network;RT simulator;electromagnetic parameter;scattering parameter;path loss;shadow fading;delay spread;radar cross sections;high frequency prediction techniques;obstructed vehicle-to-vehicle channel characterization","","71","","56","IEEE","27 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, taxi trajectory data (more than three million journeys) and social media data (more than eight thousand customer reviews) is used to calibrate the Huff model for five primary shopping centres in the rapidly expanding metropolitan city of Shenzhen, China. The Huff model is calibrated in two ways: globally, to find the single pair of best-fit parameters for attractiveness and travel cost; and locally, using Geographical Weighted Regression to find the best-fit parameters at each spatial location. Results demonstrate that customer reviews on social media provide relatively high prediction accuracy for weekend shopping behaviours when the Huff model is calibrated globally. In contrast, customer footfall, calculated directly from number of taxi journeys, provides higher prediction accuracy when the Huff model is calibrated locally. This suggests that, at weekends, sensitivity to footfall has greater spatial variance (i.e., customers living in some areas have greater preference for shopping at popular centres) than sensitivity to customer reviews (i.e., regardless of where customers live, positive reviews on social media are equally likely to affect behaviour). We present this geographical homogeneity in review sensitivity and heterogeneity in footfall sensitivity as a novel discovery with potential applications in urban, retail, and transportation planning.","","978-1-5386-4794-3","10.1109/ICBDA.2018.8367661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8367661","Social media review data;Taxi trajectory data;Huff model;Geographically Weighted Regression","Public transportation;Social network services;Calibration;Predictive models;Mathematical model;Data models;Trajectory","regression analysis;retail data processing;social networking (online);traffic engineering computing;transportation","automated prediction;taxi trajectory data;Huff model;shopping centre patronage;social media data;customers travel costs;customer reviews;Geographical Weighted Regression","","3","","18","IEEE","28 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, there is often a dynamic gap between evaluating and validating methods on fixed datasets and real driving scenarios. This letter forms part of a series of reports emanating from the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles's Decentralized and Hybrid Workshops (DHW) dedicated to the field of Scenarios Engineering. Our research proposes a scenario engineering-based calibration and validation framework for trajectory prediction of autonomous vehicles to more effectively validate the performance of the method in challenging scenarios. First, Scenarios Engineering (SE) uses OpenSCENARIO and real dataset to generate high-definition maps for challenging driving scenarios. Then, the vectorization approach is employed to extract contextual details from the scene and agent trajectory information from the HD map, and the graph neural network is used to model the high-order interaction to realize the interactive trajectory prediction. Compared with the traditional method, the trajectory prediction can be calibrated through SE so that the prediction process can use more traffic information and attribute characteristics, and improve the evaluation index of prediction.

Using frameworks like MATSIM, VehiLux, or Sumo, they often derive individual human movement indicators in their most detail. However, such agent-based models tend to be difficult and require much information and computational power to correctly predict the commutation behavior of large mobility systems. Mobility information can be costly and researchers often cannot acquire it dynamically over large areas, which leads to a lack of adequate calibration parameters, rendering the easy and spontaneous prediction of mobility in additional areas impossible. This paper targets this problem and represents a concept that combines multiple substantial mobility theorems formulated in recent years to reduce the amount of required information compared to existing simulations. Our concept also targets computational expenses and aims to reduce them to enable a global prediction of mobility. Inspired by methods from other domains, the core idea of the conceptional innovation can be compared to weather models, which predict weather on a large scale, on an adequate level of regional information (airspeed, air pressure, etc.), but without the detailed movement information of each air atom and its particular simulation.","","978-1-7281-9142-3","10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9564453","","Technological innovation;Computational modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Conferences;Estimation;Predictive models;Rendering (computer graphics)","calibration;estimation theory;mobile computing;traffic engineering computing","weather models;regional information;movement information;unified mobility estimation model;human mobility;agent-based models;computational power;commutation behavior;mobility systems;mobility information;calibration parameters;multiple substantial mobility theorems;computational expenses;conceptional innovation;human movement indicators;MATSIM;VehiLux;Sumo","","","","50","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For such scenarios, this paper constructs a car following model suitable for multi cars following based on the driving risk field theory. This model incorporates the driving information of multiple vehicles in front into the calculation of the driving state of the vehicle behind, and is highly sensitive to the acceleration change of the vehicles in front. In this paper, firstly, the distance formula is modified to make the action range of the driving risk field more in line with the real scene. And then the formula of the driving risk field is improved to enhance its sensitivity to vehicle acceleration. Finally, in the establishment of the car following model, the driving information of multiple front vehicles is brought into the driving risk field formula for calculation, so as to improve the prediction accuracy of the car following model. We conduct a comparative experiment with IDM (Intelligent Driver Model) as the comparison object, the results show that the car following model established in this paper is better than IDM in terms of fitting effect and fitting error, so it can better adapt to the multi cars following scene in the vehicle infrastructure cooperation environment.","","978-1-6654-5374-5","10.1109/CVCI56766.2022.9964837","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:82171012); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:PA2021KCPY0041); Natural science foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:2208085MF171); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9964837","driving risk field;car following model;vehicle infrastructure cooperation;modeling idea;parameter calibration","Adaptation models;Sensitivity;Roads;Fitting;Vehicle driving;Predictive models;Real-time systems","automobiles;road safety;road traffic;traffic information systems","car following model;distance formula;driving information;driving risk field;driving state;multicars following scene;vehicle acceleration;vehicle infrastructure cooperation systems;VIC","","","","17","IEEE","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research proposes a training method (BPTS - Backpropagation through Simulation) to reduce the long-term error of neural network-based car-following models, with multiple experimental validations. The training method uses a recurrent framework with simulation to generate long-term predictions for generic car-following models, and use gradient backpropagation to reduce accumulative error. The proposed training method can also calibrate other car-following models besides neural network-based models. In experimental validation, our studies yielded more than 30% error reduction in long-term (20 s) prediction for feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) models, and reduces the error on vehicle position by more than 1.0 meters, at the cost of that short-term (0.2 s) prediction error slightly increases.

The sharing economy, at its core, is to achieve efficient use of resources. However, the actual usage of shared resources is still unclear to us. Little measurement or analysis, if any, has been conducted to investigate the resource usage patterns with the large-scale data collected from these sharing systems. In this paper, we first analyze the shared bike usage patterns in three typical bike sharing systems based on 140-month multi-event data. From our data-driven analysis, we found that the most used 20% of shared bikes account for 45% of total usage, while the least used 20% of bikes account for less than 1% of usage. To efficiently utilize shared bikes, we propose a usage balancing design called eShare+ to improve the bike sharing systems by considering both the quality of service and bike maintenance, which includes three key components: (i) a statistical model based on archived data to infer historical usage; (ii) an entropy and contextual LSTM-based prediction model with both real-time and archived data to infer future usage; (iii) a model-driven optimal calibration engine for bike selection to dynamically balance usage. We develop an ID swapping-based evaluation methodology to measure the efficiency of eShare+ with data from three large-scale bike sharing systems including 84,000 bikes and 3,300 service stations. Our results show that eShare+ not only fully utilizes shared bikes with efficient maintenance but also improves the quality of service.

The HNNTA model employs the convolutional neural network (CNN) for extracting sectional features from the IMU data, followed by the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture the global temporal information. A temporal attention mechanism is designed to weigh the hidden states produced by the LSTM network and generate the final features for velocity prediction. Specifically, the proposed temporal attention mechanism is composed of the CNN feature refinement module and the sigmoid score normalization function. We utilize different 1-D filters to refine the temporal hidden states from previous refined time indexes and form the value matrix with each row containing different features along with the entire window time indexes and each column representing individual features from the same time spans. We then employ the sigmoid function to normalize the dot-product alignment between features from different time spans and that of the last refined time index. We employ the RoNIN dataset to evaluate the HNNTA model, which contains the largest and most natural IMU measurements. We employ extensive erosion experiments to show the effectiveness of the HNNTA model design. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, the HNNTA model provides 10.39% higher 50th percentile accuracy for all phone carriers that have been seen in the training set and 8.69% higher for those that have not been seen.

Noise levels of various sources, when integrated with the terrain data, are playing a vital role in determining the extent of noise pollution at various neighboring locations. The technique is tried to be developed over a typical city in India, i.e., Lucknow, with mixed land use pattern is chosen thus far. Further, an important variation in noise levels exists here from a place to another. It also varies with time in this city.

In addition, our implementation can meet the real-time requirement ( $< 125 \mu \text{s}$ ) in 5G NR.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2021.3126084","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1617634); Virginia Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI); Virginia Tech Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science (ICTAS); NVIDIA AI Lab (NVAIL) in Santa Clara, CA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606643","5G NR;eMBB;URLLC;multiplexing;preemptive puncturing;link adaptation;link reliability;MCS selection;deep learning;GPU","Ultra reliable low latency communication;Throughput;5G mobile communication;Reliability;Modulation;Long Term Evolution;Interference","5G mobile communication;deep learning (artificial intelligence);error statistics;modulation coding;multiplexing;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic","DELUXE;preemptive puncturing;MCS selection;deep learning;DL-based link adaptation;eMBB multiplexing;URLLC multiplexing;5G NR;ultrareliable and low latency communications;delay sensitive applications;enhanced mobile broadband service;eMBB service link reliability performance;modulation and coding scheme;block-error rate;BLER;MathWorks 5G toolbox;spectral efficiency","","8","","51","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, curbs are difficult to detect in complex urban environments in which many dynamic objects exist. Additionally, curbs appear in a variety of shapes and sizes. Previous studies have been based on the traditional pipeline, which consists of the extraction and aggregation of hand-crafted features that are then fed to classifiers. However, this sequential process is inefficient and designing the hand-crafted features is a complex process. Recently, this kind of process has been replaced by Deep Neural Networks (DNN), in which classifiers and features are learned from large-scale data. Very few works have exploited DNN for the curb detection problem. Most works use multi-modal sensor-based methods that combine images and accumulated 3D point clouds from LIDAR. However, these approaches require synchronization and calibration between sensors. In addition, they do not quantify the uncertainty of their predictions for autonomous system safety. In this paper, we present a two-stage DNN-based curb detection method that includes uncertainty quantification. An autoencoder-based network predicts the curbs, and then conditional neural processes rectify the predictions with uncertainty estimations. The experimental results show that our approach achieves high accuracy and recall in complex areas. We also constructed a large-scale dataset to create benchmarks consisting of approximately 5,224 scans with bird’s-eye view labels collected from urban areas. To the best of our knowledge, there are no public datasets for DNN-based curb detectors. The benchmarks and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/YounghwaJung/curb_detection_DNN.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-9077-8","10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561358","National Research Foundation of Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9561358","","Deep learning;Uncertainty;Three-dimensional displays;Urban areas;Benchmark testing;Feature extraction;Safety","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;image sequences;object detection;optical radar;sensor fusion;shape recognition;traffic engineering computing","uncertainty-aware fast curb detection;convolutional networks;autonomous vehicles;hand-crafted features;deep neural networks;curb detection problem;multimodal sensor-based methods;autonomous system safety;curb detection method;uncertainty quantification;autoencoder-based network;conditional neural processes;DNN-based curb detectors","","3","","38","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Field observations identified the degree of passenger crowding on the bus as one of the primary causes for the unpredictability of passengers’ average boarding time (ABT). Consequently, the internal areas of buses were divided for the first time to assess the impact of the passenger density distribution (PDD) on the ABT, using field data. An effective BPR function was proposed that accurately predicts the passengers’ ABT. Then, to show the influence of passenger movement preference and density distribution on ABT, a new floor field model was developed. Calibration and validation results indicate that the model can reproduce the dynamic moving process of passengers’ distribution on the bus and clarify the influence of PDD on ABT. Finally, three bus design strategies are proposed to enhance boarding efficiency, and the simulation results show that the optimal strategy improves passenger ABT and improve the operational performance of bus transit. These findings provide theoretical support for bus design as well as for bus operation.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3124296","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71571109,71971125,71771168,71621001,71871130); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606532","Service time;passenger density distribution;average boarding time;BPR function;cellular automata;potential field","Predictive models;Schedules;Uncertainty;Numerical models;Delays;Data models;Business process re-engineering","optimisation;public transport;road vehicles","time estimation;passenger density distribution;bus service time;bus transit;field observations;passenger crowding;field data;passenger movement preference;floor field model;bus design strategies;boarding efficiency;passenger ABT;bus operation;PDD;passenger average boarding time","","1","","44","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, driving style is difficult to identify due to temporal and spatial differences and scene heterogeneity of driving behavior data. As such, the study of real-time driving-style identification methods is of great significance for formulating personalized driving strategies, improving traffic safety and reducing fuel consumption. This study aims to establish a driving style recognition framework based on longitudinal driving operation conditions (DOCs) using a machine learning model and natural driving data collected by a vehicle equipped with an advanced driving assistance system (ADAS). Design/methodology/approach - Specifically, a driving style recognition framework based on longitudinal DOCs was established. To train the model, a real-world driving experiment was conducted. First, the driving styles of 44 drivers were preliminarily identified through natural driving data and video data; drivers were categorized through a subjective evaluation as conservative, moderate or aggressive. Then, based on the ADAS driving data, a criterion for extracting longitudinal DOCs was developed. Third, taking the ADAS data from 47 Kms of the two test expressways as the research object, six DOCs were calibrated and the characteristic data sets of the different DOCs were extracted and constructed. Finally, four machine learning classification (MLC) models were used to classify and predict driving style based on the natural driving data. Findings - The results showed that six longitudinal DOCs were calibrated according to the proposed calibration criterion. Cautious drivers undertook the largest proportion of the free cruise condition (FCC), while aggressive drivers primarily undertook the FCC, following steady condition and relative approximation condition. Compared with cautious and moderate drivers, aggressive drivers adopted a smaller time headway (THW) and distance headway (DHW). THW, time-to-collision (TTC) and DHW showed highly significant differences in driving style identification, while longitudinal acceleration (LA) showed no significant difference in driving style identification. Speed and TTC showed no significant difference between moderate and aggressive drivers. In consideration of the cross-validation results and model prediction results, the overall hierarchical prediction performance ranking of the four studied machine learning models under the current sample data set was extreme gradient boosting > multi-layer perceptron > logistic regression > support vector machine. Originality/value - The contribution of this research is to propose a criterion and solution for using longitudinal driving behavior data to label longitudinal DOCs and rapidly identify driving styles based on those DOCs and MLC models. This study provides a reference for real-time online driving style identification in vehicles equipped with onboard data acquisition equipment, such as ADAS.","2399-9802","","10.1108/JICV-07-2021-0008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10004519","Machine learning;Advanced driver assistant systems;Driver behaviors and assistance;Sensor data processing","Vehicles;Behavioral sciences;Data models;Roads;Real-time systems;Data mining;Safety","","","","2","","","","30 Dec 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"
