	abstract = {In the last decades, the continuous concentric development of big cities has driven an increase in the number of trips performed by private vehicles to/from the city centers, resulting not only in an increase in congestion but also acting as a major contributor to the issues related to traffic pollution.In this connection, although several strategies have been investigated and implemented, modal shifting from private vehicles to public transport still remains the most effective. In this connection, to enforce the usage of sustainable transport modes, the concept of Low Emission Zones (LEZs) has been implemented in many cities in order to restrict the admission of the most polluting vehicles, allowing only the circulation of more sustainable transport modes.Nevertheless, LEZ design is often based on a trial and error approach relying on the experience of the designer and, often, strongly dependent on the particular city under analysis.In order to support the generalization of the LEZ design problem, this paper explores the potentialities of an optimization-based approach aiming at determining the biggest area to include in the LEZ while, at the same time, minimizing the increase of users’ generalized costs and saturation over links. To test the capabilities of the proposed approach, a case study is also analyzed.},

	abstract = {Low emissions zones (LEZs) have emerged as a key strategy in addressing urban air pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To effectively manage and enforce LEZs, optimization of mobility, intelligent transport systems, multi-modal mobility, and mobility as a service must be considered as objectives to be reached. In the same direction, public authorities have included in their strategic plans to make their city "more sustainable and smarter. In this sense, a comprehensive toot that integrates advanced technologies and data-driven approaches is essential. To overcome this limitation, Libelium proposes in this work a LEZ management software for smart decission making. It integrates various components such as real-time monitoring, data analytics, air quality modeling, and KPIs computation. Our solutions utilize a combination of sensors, cameras, and communication networks to collect real-time data on vehicle emissions, traffic patterns, and compliance levels within the designated low emissions zones. This paper shows promising results in this context validated in five European cities - Paris, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Stavanger, and Tallinn - obtaining a CO2eq emissions reduction up to 86 \% in the best scenarios. In addition, the dispersion models can achieve a high resolution at a street level. For this reason, the tool for low emissions zone management presents a comprehensive and integrated approach to monitor, enforce, and evaluate LEZs effectively. The tool enables authorities to effectively combat urban air pollution and reduce emissions by leveraging real-time monitoring, data analytics, and sustainability impact assessment. Implementing such a tool has the potential to create cleaner and healthier urban environments, enhance transportation sustainability, and improve the overall quality of life for citizens.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Cities are the world’s engines of economic growth, innovation, and social change, but they are also hot spots for human exposure to air pollution, mainly originating from road traffic. As the urban population continues to grow, a greater quantity of people risk exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), and therefore also risk adverse health effects. In many cities, there is scope for further improvement in air quality through targeted urban policy interventions. The objective of this protocol is to detail the methods that will be used for a systematic evidence map (SEM) which will identify and characterize the evidence on policy interventions that can be implemented at the urban-level to reduce traffic emissions and/or TRAP from on-road mobile sources, thus reducing human exposures and adverse health impacts.
Methods
Articles will be searched for and selected based on a predetermined search strategy and eligibility criteria. A variety of databases will be searched for relevant articles published in English between January 1, 2000 and June 1, 2020 to encompass the interdisciplinary nature of this SEM, and articles will be stored and screened using Rayyan QCRI. Predetermined study characteristics will be extracted and coded from included studies in a Microsoft Excel sheet, which will serve as an open access, interactive database, and two authors will review the coded data for consistency. The database will be queryable, and various interactive charts, graphs, and maps will be created using Tableau Public for data visualization. The results of the evidence mapping will be detailed via narrative summary.
Conclusion
This protocol serves to increase transparency of the SEM methods and provides an example for researchers pursuing future SEMs.},

	abstract = {Focusing on the critical challenge of air pollution in urban areas, primarily caused by vehicular emissions, this study proposes an innovative process for Low Emission Zones (LEZ) design within the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) framework. Our primary focus is on enhancing urban mobility through the strategic design of LEZs, while simultaneously maintaining or even improving emission levels. The novel aspect of the approach lies in the use of LEZs with minimal geometric boundaries, strategically designed to balance the reduction of CO2 emissions and the necessity of fluid urban transportation. LEZs are calculated using genetic algorithms that optimize a cost function balancing emissions and travel time while applying topological and specific constraints. Several experiments are simulated with SUMO to compare the efficiency of urban mobility under various LEZ configurations and different traffic demands. The results show the improvement of the approach in comparison with traditional LEZ design methodologies. The proposal not only preserves or even reduces the emission levels, but also actively improves urban mobility and traffic flow. This empirical evidence strongly supports the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution in different urban scenarios. The design of the heuristic enables the possibility to create dynamic LEZs that may be changed depending on demand, weather, or any other varying conditions that affect traffic and emissions, preserving the mobility concerns of the users.},

The main purpose of those electronic toll systems is to restrict the access of vehicles to certain city areas, named low emission zones. Since its adoption, this solution has proven to be quite promising. However, current proposals are still far from being ideal. More specifically, current schemes still introduce a significant error percentage in the detection of fraudulent drivers. Moreover, they usually require toll systems to be equipped with cameras that take pictures of all the vehicles that pass through the control points. This behavior may represent a serious privacy threat for the drivers. In this article, a new electronic toll system is proposed. The aim of the new proposal is to detect fraud while preserving drivers privacy. More concretely, it provides a non-probabilistic fraud control, and the control points only take pictures of the vehicles that misbehave. Last but not least, the proposed system applies an enhanced dynamic pricing that can help the authorities to better distribute traffic over the road network.

	abstract = {Ambitious goals to combat pollution should be supported in policies that discourage the use of private cars, notably old and more polluting vehicles. Price signals, such as a congestion tax, and traffic restrictions, such as low-emission zones (LEZ), are widely used tools among European cities to limit car use. In this paper, we look at the dissuasive effect of the implementation of the Madrid Central LEZ and analyze how traffic intensity has been affected in both the restricted area and in other zones of the city. Although the ultimate policy goal of LEZ is to reduce pollution, the instrument considered is traffic limitations, so it is important to know whether or not traffic intensity has been affected by traffic restrictions. Despite its limited extension and the adoption of long transitional periods, the LEZ of Madrid has been seriously questioned from its inception. The results show that traffic intensity has been reduced in the Madrid Central zone but has unfortunately increased in bordering areas. Previous studies on the effects of Madrid Central have not taken into account this potential substitution effect. The future design of a mobility policy in the metropolitan area of Madrid should address this undesirable outcome.},

The goal of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of low emission zones (LEZs) and to compare it with the existing results in literature on the effectiveness of urban tolls. First, we build up a theoretical model that departs from De Borger and Proost (2012), who study the effects of urban tolls on congestion, by incorporating pollution into the analysis and LEZs as an alternative (quantity-based) policy measure. Then we perform an econometric analysis taking advantage of a unique and extremely original panel of large European urban areas over the period 2008–2016, using data on congestion from TomTom and data on pollution (PM2.5) from environmental sciences. We conclude that LEZs can curb pollution. They are particularly effective in highly polluted cities, when they are applied to a wide area of the city, and/or when they are stringent in the type of restricted vehicles. Instead, LEZs are ineffective in mitigating congestion. This is a very relevant result, given the growing importance of LEZs in Europe.},

This traffic control method has been already deployed in important cities such as London or Singapore, and several others are planning to implement them in the mid-term. While the current LEZ solutions have proven to be feasible, they have also turned out to require costly infrastructures such as expensive road side units and vehicle equipment. Moreover, their intrusive nature has raised social alarms regarding the potential violation of the drivers’ privacy that their use may represent. To address these issues, this paper presents an access control system for LEZs specially designed to provide effective anti-fraud measures while preserving the privacy of the drivers who behave honestly. The new scheme is lightweight enough to be used in low-cost infrastructures. Moreover, the only equipment required at the driver’s side is a common smartphone enabled with typical communication capabilities. One of the cornerstones of the proposal is its deployability in real scenarios, for this reason, the feasibility of the new technology is validated in a relevant environment and an extensive evaluation is provided.},

	abstract = {The link between transport related emissions and human health is a major issue for city municipalities worldwide. PM emissions from exhaust and non-exhaust sources are one of the main worrying contributors to air-pollution. In this paper, we challenge the notion that a ban on internal combustion engine vehicles will result in clean and safe air in our cities, since emissions from tyres and other non-exhaust sources are expected to increase in the near future. To this end, we present data from the city of Dublin that document that the current amount of tyre-related PM emissions in the city might already be above or close to the levels deemed safe by the World Health Organization. As a solution to this problem, we present a feedback-enabled distributed access control mechanism and ride-sharing scheme to limit the number of vehicles in a city and therefore maintain the amount of transport-related PM to safe levels.},
